## Testing with Multiple Users

2. Each tab acts as a separate user.
3. Start drawing in one window — you should instantly see the same drawing appear in the others in real time.

### For Different System but on Same Network 
1. Find your local IP address.
2. Access from other devices: `http://IP_ADDRESS:3000`.
3. Make sure all devices are on the same network.

### Through Internet

**NOTE:** The Hosted website can be slow make sure the website is connected (green dot at top right corner).

2. **No Export Option**: You can’t save or download your drawing at the moment.
